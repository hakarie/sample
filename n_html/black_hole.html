	<h2>What are Black Holes?</h2>
        <p>A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity.</p>

        <h2>Properties of Black Holes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Event Horizon:</strong> The boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of a black hole.</li>
            <li><strong>Singularity:</strong> A point of infinite density at the center of a black hole.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaghettification:</strong> The process where tidal forces near a black hole stretch objects into long thin shapes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Black Holes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes:</strong> Formed from the collapse of massive stars.</li>
            <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes:</strong> Found at the centers of most galaxies and can have masses millions to billions of times that of the Sun.</li>
            <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes:</strong> With masses between stellar and supermassive black holes.</li>
        </ul>        
        <h2>Research and Discoveries</h2>
        <p>Scientists continue to study black holes using telescopes and other instruments. Discoveries such as gravitational waves have provided new insights into their behavior and the universe as a whole.</p>
        
        <h2>Further Reading</h2>
        <p>For more information about black holes, you can explore books, articles, and documentaries by renowned physicists and astronomers like Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, and Andrea Ghez.</p>
