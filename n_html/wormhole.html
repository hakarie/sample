			<h2>What are Wormholes?</h2>
				<p>In essence, wormholes are hypothetical connections between two separate points in spacetime, potentially allowing travel between them. 
				They are predicted by the theory of general relativity, developed by Albert Einstein. 
				This theory suggests that massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, creating a curvature. 
				Wormholes could be a consequence of this extreme warping, where spacetime folds back onto itself, creating a tunnel-like connection.</p>

			<h2>Here are some key aspects of wormholes</h2>
			<ul>
           				<li><strong>Entrance and Exit:</strong> A wormhole would likely have two openings, one at each end, connecting two different regions of spacetime. </li>
				<li><strong>Spacetime Distortion:</strong> The passage through a wormhole would involve traversing a highly distorted region of spacetime, with intense gravitational forces. </li>
            				<li><strong>Hypothetical Existence:</strong>  While mathematically possible within general relativity, there's no concrete evidence to confirm the existence of wormholes.</li>

			<h2>Wormholes: Theoretical Tunnels Through Spacetime</h2>
			<p>Wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges, are fascinating theoretical pathways that could connect distant regions of spacetime. 
			Imagine them as shortcuts, like tunnels, that bend space and time to allow travel between faraway locations much faster than the speed of light.</p>
			<h2>Beyond the Horizon: The Future of Wormhole Research</h2>
			<p>The search for evidence of wormholes is ongoing. Scientists are looking for specific signatures, such as distortions in spacetime caused by a wormhole's immense gravity. 
			Additionally, theoretical physicists are exploring ways to stabilize wormholes or identify naturally occurring conditions that could make them traversable.</p>
