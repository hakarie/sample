<div id="d3">
<p>
In April 2019, astronomers announced to the world that they had done the unthinkable: they had managed to photograph - for the very first time - a black hole. 
The black hole in question is about 6.5 million times the mass of the Sun and resides in galaxy M87, 55 million lightyears from Earth.<br>
<br>The supermassive black hole imaged by the EHT is located in the center of the elliptical galaxy M87, located about 55 million light years from Earth. 
This image was captured by FORS2 on ESO's Very Large Telescope. The short linear feature near the center of the image is a jet produced by the black hole.

	The Photo was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an array which linked together eight existing radio observatories across the planet to form a single “Earth-sized” virtual telescope.
